Set the camera target in any character.

value 1: Character to set. exemple: on the script you put
         on the value "charName = pico1" so you will put 
        "pico1" on the value 1 without the quotes. (you can 
         make this focus on boyfriend, dad or gf too)

value 2: Characte Group. (can be 'boyfriendGroup', 
         'dadGroup or 'gfGroup')
